# UI Implementation Standards

This rule defines the UI implementation standards for the project, including component library selection, design system, layout patterns, and best practices. When developing new features, these standards must be followed to ensure UI consistency and high quality.

## Component Libraries

- Use `shadcn/ui` as the base component library
- Component storage location: `components/ui/`
- Extended component types: Blocks, Charts, Marketing Blocks
- Use `Magic UI` as an enhanced component library, reference: https://magicui.design/
- Use `Origin UI` as an enhanced component library, reference: https://originui.com/ 
- Use `Tailark` as a marketing blocks component library

## Project Common Components

- Page Header Component: `page-header.tsx` (includes title and description)
- Social Sharing Component: `social-shares.tsx`

## Design System

- Color System: primary, secondary, accent, neutral
- Typography System: Chinese - Noto Sans SC, English - Inter
- Spacing: Follow a 4px grid system
- Animation: Use Framer Motion

## Layout Patterns

- Responsive Breakpoints: sm: 640px, md: 768px, lg: 1024px, xl: 1280px
- Grid System: CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Container Width: Default: 1110px, Wide: 1280px, Narrow: 768px

## Best Practices

- Performance: Lazy loading of components, image optimization, animation performance optimization
- Accessibility: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, color contrast
- Reusability: Abstract common components, standardize Props, reuse styles
- Toast Component: Use `sonner` as the toast notification component

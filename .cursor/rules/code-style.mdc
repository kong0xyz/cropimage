# Code Style Guidelines

This rule defines the coding style standards for the project to ensure code consistency and readability. When writing code, these guidelines must be followed.

## Naming Conventions

- **Variables**: Use camelCase for variable names
- **Constants**: Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- **Functions**: Use camelCase for function names
- **Components**: Use PascalCase for React component names
- **Files**: Use kebab-case for file names

## Code Structure

- **Indentation**: Use 2 spaces for indentation
- **Line Length**: Limit lines to 100 characters
- **Braces**: Use Egyptian braces (opening brace on the same line)

## Comments

- Use JSDoc for function and component documentation
- Add explanatory comments for complex logic

## Imports and Exports

- Group imports by source (standard library, third-party, local)
- Use named exports over default exports when possible

## Error Handling

- Always use try/catch for async operations
- Log errors appropriately with context

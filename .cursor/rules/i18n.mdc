# Internationalization (i18n) Development Standards

This rule defines the standards for internationalization in the project to ensure consistency and completeness in localization efforts.

## Development Process

- Use `next-i18next` for React and Next.js internationalization
- All user-facing text must be localized, including metadata

## Resource File Structure

- Resource files are located in `messages/` directory
- File naming convention: `{locale}.json` (e.g., `en.json`, `zh.json`)
- Nested structure for organizing keys (e.g., `common.title`, `nav.menu`)

## Metadata Localization

- SEO metadata (title, description) must be localized for each page
- Open Graph and Twitter Card metadata must also be localized

## Naming Conventions for Keys

- Use dot notation for hierarchy (e.g., `page.home.title`)
- Be descriptive but concise (e.g., `button.submit` instead of `btn`)
- Group related keys under common namespaces

@messages/en.json
@messages/zh.json

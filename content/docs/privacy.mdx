## Privacy Statement

Your privacy is critically important to us. At {siteConfig.legal.name}, we have a few fundamental principles:

- We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it
- We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law or protect our rights
- We don't store personal information unless required for the ongoing operation of our service
- **Most importantly: We process all images locally in your browser, meaning your images never leave your device**

## How Our Image Cropping Service Works

Our image cropping tool is designed with privacy as the top priority:

- **Local Processing**: All image cropping, editing, and processing happens entirely within your web browser using client-side JavaScript
- **No Uploads**: Your images are never uploaded to our servers or any third-party services
- **No Storage**: We do not store, cache, or retain any of your images or image data
- **Immediate Disposal**: Once you close your browser or navigate away from our site, all image data is immediately disposed of

## Information We Don't Collect

Because our service operates entirely in your browser, we do **NOT** collect:
- Your images or any image content
- Image metadata (EXIF data, location information, etc.)
- Personal photos or any visual content you process
- File names or image properties

## Information We May Collect

We may collect limited, non-personal information for service improvement:

- **Analytics Data**: General usage statistics (page views, session duration, browser type) through privacy-focused analytics
- **Technical Information**: Browser type, operating system, and device information for compatibility and optimization
- **Error Reports**: Anonymous error logs to help us improve the service (no personal data included)

## Cookies and Local Storage

Our website may use:
- **Essential Cookies**: Required for basic website functionality
- **Analytics Cookies**: To understand how visitors use our site (anonymized data only)
- **Local Storage**: To temporarily store your preferences (crop settings, export format preferences) locally on your device

You can control cookie preferences through your browser settings.

## Third-Party Services

We use minimal third-party services:
- **Analytics**: Privacy-focused analytics services that don't track individuals
- **CDN Services**: For faster content delivery (no personal data involved)

## Children's Privacy

Our service does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13. Since we don't collect personal information or store images, our service is inherently safe for users of all ages.

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect or store personal data or images, traditional data protection rights (access, deletion, portability) are not applicable. However, you have the right to:
- Use our service anonymously
- Clear your browser data at any time
- Contact us with privacy concerns

## Data Security

While we don't store your images, we implement security measures to protect our website:
- HTTPS encryption for all communications
- Regular security updates and monitoring
- Secure hosting infrastructure

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify users of any material changes by posting the new policy on this page with an updated date.

## International Users

Our service is designed to work globally while respecting local privacy laws including GDPR, CCPA, and other regional regulations. Since we don't collect personal data or images, compliance is inherently built into our service design.

## Contact Us

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our practices, please contact us at <Mailto email={siteConfig.legal.email} />.

## Transparency

We believe in complete transparency about our practices. If you have technical questions about how our image processing works or want to verify our privacy claims, our code architecture ensures that you can inspect browser developer tools to confirm that no image data is transmitted to external servers.

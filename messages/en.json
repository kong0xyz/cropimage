      "supportedFormats": {
        "question": "What image formats are supported for resizing?",
        "answer": "Our image resizer supports JPEG, PNG, and WebP formats. You can upload files up to 50MB in size and convert between different formats during the resize process."
      },
      "qualityImpact": {
        "question": "Will resizing affect image quality?",
        "answer": "When enlarging images, some quality loss is inevitable due to interpolation. When reducing size, quality is generally well-preserved. We use advanced algorithms to minimize quality degradation during resizing."
      },
      "aspectRatio": {
        "question": "Can I maintain the aspect ratio while resizing?",
        "answer": "Yes! You can choose to maintain the original aspect ratio (proportional resize) or stretch the image to exact dimensions. The aspect ratio lock helps prevent distortion."
      },
      "resizeMethods": {
        "question": "What resize methods are available?",
        "answer": "You can resize by percentage (e.g., 50% of original), exact pixel dimensions, or choose from preset sizes for common use cases like thumbnails, social media, or print formats."
      },
      "imageSizeLimit": {
        "question": "Is there a limit on image size?",
        "answer": "You can upload images up to 50MB. The maximum output dimensions depend on your browser's capabilities, but typically support very large images up to 10,000x10,000 pixels."
      },
      "batchResize": {
        "question": "Can I batch resize multiple images?",
        "answer": "Currently, the tool processes one image at a time. For multiple images, you'll need to resize them individually. We're considering batch processing for future updates."
      },
      "privacy": {
        "question": "Are my images uploaded to a server?",
        "answer": "No, all image processing happens locally in your browser. Your images are never uploaded to our servers, ensuring complete privacy and faster processing."
      },
      "undoResize": {
        "question": "Can I undo a resize operation?",
        "answer": "You can use the reset function to clear the current session and start over with the original image. However, once you download a resized image, you'll need the original to make further changes."
      }
    }
